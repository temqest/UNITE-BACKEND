Key action symbols

V = view

AC = accept

RJ = reject

RS = resched (reviewer proposes a new date/time and sends it back to requester)

Flow model (two-step reschedule exchange)

Requester creates a reschedule request (initial request).

Requester actions: V only.

Reviewer actions: V, AC, RJ, RS.

If reviewer picks AC → request accepted → final status changed accordingly.

If reviewer picks RJ → request rejected → final status changed accordingly.

If reviewer picks RS → reviewer proposes a new schedule and sends the proposal back to the requester.

Reviewer-proposed resched (after reviewer used RS) — now the requester receives a reviewer-proposed reschedule and must respond.

Requester actions: V, AC, RJ (they may accept the reviewer-proposed schedule or reject it).

Reviewer at this stage has no further actions on that pending proposal (unless your system allows multiple proposal rounds — see edge cases).

Important invariant: A user must never be able to accept/reject their own request in the initial step. (If they are also the reviewer by role, the reviewer powers apply only when they are not the request creator or unless a well-defined override exists.)

Legend:

Initial = initial resched request created by Requester.

ReviewerRS = reviewer chose RS and sent a proposed schedule back to Requester.

Master table — Initial request (Requester creates request)
Requester → Reviewer	Requester (Initial)	Reviewer (Initial)
Admin → Coordinator	V	V, AC, RJ, RS
Coordinator → Admin	V	V, AC, RJ, RS
Stakeholder → Coordinator	V	V, AC, RJ, RS
Stakeholder → Admin	V	V, AC, RJ, RS
Coordinator → Stakeholder	V	V, AC, RJ, RS
Admin → Stakeholder	V	V, AC, RJ, RS
Master table — After reviewer used RS (Reviewer proposes new schedule)
Requester ← Reviewer (proposal)	Requester (on proposed resched)	Reviewer (after proposing)
Admin ← Coordinator (C proposed)	V, AC, RJ	(no actions on the proposed request / or view only)
Coordinator ← Admin (A proposed)	V, AC, RJ	(no actions / view only)
Coordinator ← Stakeholder (S proposed)	V, AC, RJ	(no actions / view only)
Admin ← Stakeholder (S proposed)	V, AC, RJ	(no actions / view only)
Stakeholder ← Admin (A proposed)	V, AC, RJ	(no actions / view only)
Stakeholder ← Coordinator (C proposed)	V, AC, RJ	(no actions / view only)

Implementation note: after the reviewer proposes (RS), the proposal becomes a new pending decision for the original requester to accept/reject. You can allow multiple proposal rounds (reviewer proposes again after requester rejects), but that must be explicit in your workflow rules.
